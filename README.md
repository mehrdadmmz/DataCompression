# Data Compression Algorithms 🚀🚀

This repository contains implementations of various algorithms used in data compression and image processing. Each module focuses on a specific technique, allowing you to explore, test, and understand different approaches to data compression.

## Implementations

- **Arithmetic Encoding** 💻
  Implements arithmetic encoding for efficient lossless data compression.

- **Colour Space Conversion** 🎨
  Provides functions to convert images between different colour spaces, a key step in many image processing pipelines.

- **Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT)** ⌨️
  Implements the DCT to convert spatial data into frequency components, a core component of many compression algorithms.

- **Dithering** 💽
  Simulates higher color depth in images with a limited palette by spreading quantization errors.

- **Huffman Coding** 💫
  Uses Huffman coding for generating optimal prefix codes based on symbol frequencies, another essential tool for lossless compression.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites 🚀🚀

- Python 3.7 or later
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)  
- (Other dependencies as specified in each module's documentation)

### Running the Code 🚀🚀

Each algorithm is implemented in its own module with usage examples and test cases. For instance, to test the Discrete Cosine Transform module, simply run:

```bash
python discrete_cosine_transform.py
